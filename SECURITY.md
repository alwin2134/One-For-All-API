# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

At One-For-All API, we take security seriously and value the contributions of ethical security researchers. If you discover any security vulnerabilities or weaknesses in our system, we encourage you to responsibly disclose them to us.

To report a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Privately Disclose**: Please report the vulnerability to us privately, before making it public. You can send an email to [business.alwin.mathew@gmail.com](mailto:business.alwin.mathew@gmail.com). Please avoid sharing details of the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed by our team.

2. **Provide Details**: In your report, please include detailed information about the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce it, potential impact, and any relevant technical details.

3. **Responsible Disclosure**: Allow us a reasonable amount of time to investigate and address the vulnerability before disclosing it publicly. We are committed to promptly addressing security issues and will keep you informed of our progress.

4. **Respect Confidentiality**: Please respect the confidentiality of any sensitive information you may access during your research. Do not access or modify data that does not belong to you, and do not perform any actions that could disrupt our services or harm our users.

We appreciate your cooperation in helping us maintain the security of our system and protect our users' data. Thank you for your responsible disclosure and dedication to improving online security.

**Note**: This security policy applies to vulnerabilities discovered within the One-For-All API platform. Issues related to third-party services or libraries should be reported to the respective maintainers or security teams.
